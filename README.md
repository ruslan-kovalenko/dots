### Description
Dots is an abstract strategy game, played by two or more people on a sheet of squared paper. The game is somewhat similar to Go, in that the goal is to "capture" enemy dots by surrounding them with a continuous line of one's own dots. Once an area containing enemy dots is surrounded, that area ceases to be playable.
